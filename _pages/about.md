I'm Sebastian, a Programming Languages researcher and engineer.
Since 2015, I have been a core contributor to the development of the [Lean programming language and theorem prover](https://lean-lang.org).
After finishing my PhD on the design of the current version of Lean, Lean 4, in 2023, I co-founded the [Lean Focused Research Organization](https://lean-fro.org) together with Leonardo de Moura, the creator of Lean.
I love developing research ideas into usable, and in particular efficient, implementations in order to put them into the hands of users.

When not programming, I instead enjoy following program-guided activities such as playing rhythm games and the piano.
